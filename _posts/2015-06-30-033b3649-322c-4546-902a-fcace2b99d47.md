Hey, I'm Jon.

I work at The Grid teaching robots how to build beautiful websites.

I became a lot happier in life when I stopped trying to decide whether to call myself a designer or developer, but I care equally about typography, functional programming, grid systems and algorithms --- I guess beauty, simplicity and elegance transcends medium.

I have a British passport but I hop around the world working from wherever there are friends, sunshine and cafes with power outlets. Right now I'm in San Francisco but I have vague plans for Stockholm, Berlin and Portland for the rest of 2015\.

I'm not available to hire, but you can tweet me cat .gifs, Buckminster Fuller quotes and jokes about immutable data structures --- @jongold.
