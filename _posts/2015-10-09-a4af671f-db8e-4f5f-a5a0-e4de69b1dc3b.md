Hey, I'm Jon.

I work at The Grid teaching robots how to build beautiful websites.
I became a lot happier in life when I stopped trying to decide whether to call myself a designer or developer, but I care equally about typography, functional programming, grid systems and algorithms --- I guess beauty, simplicity and elegance transcends medium.

I have a British passport but I hop around the world working from wherever there are friends, sunshine and cafes with power outlets. Right now I'm in San Francisco; other recent happy places have included Portland, Black Rock City, Berlin & Stockholm.

I'm not available to hire, but you can tweet me cat .gifs, Buckminster Fuller quotes and jokes about immutable data structures.
