# Functional Programming, CSS, and your sanity

Learning Clojure and/or Haskell will make you a better programmer. Even if you don't use it day to day, there are a ton of prescient lessons to be taken back to your language of choice.

Functional programming is infectious. I find it beautiful & elegant in much the same way as a Braun watch or Karl Gerstner's grid system for Capital magazine. Good design (my preferred school of good design, at least) is mathsy, rational and pure---and CSS is design---so it follows that there are a bunch of lessons we can bring back from FP land into design.
